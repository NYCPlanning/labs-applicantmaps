    <h3>Proposed Rezoning: Commercial Overlays</h3>
      <p>Proposed Rezoning refers to any changes to existing zoning district boundaries that are necessary to continue with proposed developments. Zoning boundaries are not dependent on lot lines and can sometimes intersect tax lots.</p>
      <div class="text-small">
          <ul>
            <li> <strong>You can either edit an existing zoning boundary or draw a new zoning boundary using the draw tool</strong></li>
            <li> Select the polygon tool to begin drawing a new shape (you can draw multiple shapes)</li>
            <li> Complete a shape by clicking the final vertex a second time</li>
            <li> Edit an existing zoning boundary or a drawn shape by selecting and then dragging vertices</li>
            <li> Use the trash button (or delete key) to delete a selected shape or vertex</li>
            <li> Type in the zoning designation code for a new zoning boundary in the box</li>
            <li> Once you're finished, save the geometry</li>
