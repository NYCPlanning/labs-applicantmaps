    <p>The Project Area refers to all properties that would be subject to the proposed actions. The Project Area should only be used if it is larger than the Development Site.</p>
    <ul>
      <li> Select the polygon tool to begin drawing a new shape (you can draw multiple shapes)</li>
      <li> Complete a shape by clicking the final vertex a second time</li>
      <li> Edit a completed shape by selecting then dragging vertices</li>
      <li> Use the trash button (or delete key) to delete a selected shape or vertex</li>
      <li> Once you're finished drawing, save the geometry</li>
    </ul>
  {{else}}
  <p> The Development Site refers to the zoning lot(s) to be improved by the specific development(s) that the land use actions would facilitate.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Select tax lots to highlight them</li>
      <li>Selected lots will be yellow</li>
      <li>Once you're finished selecting lots, save the geometry</li>
